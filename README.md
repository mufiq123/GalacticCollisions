# GalacticCollisions

To change the size and movement of the galaxies, modify the values in the galaxies dictionary in the galcol_driver.py file

By default, running the driver will create two .gif files named Collision2D and Collisions3D in the project folder

To view specific collisions as well as the research report behind the code click the link below:
